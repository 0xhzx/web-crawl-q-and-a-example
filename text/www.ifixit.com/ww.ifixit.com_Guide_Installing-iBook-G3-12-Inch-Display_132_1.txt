Step 2

                  Keyboard               








 




 
Pull the keyboard release tabs toward you and lift up on the keyboard until it pops free.



 
If the keyboard does not come free, use a small flathead screwdriver to turn the keyboard locking screw 180 degrees in either direction and try again.



 
Flip the keyboard over, away from the screen, and rest it face-down on the trackpad area.

Step 15








 




 
Breathe deeply. Trying times are ahead, but we promise the lower case does come off.



 
Push the thin rims of the lower case surrounding the battery compartment in, bending them past the tabs, and then lift up to free that corner of the lower case.

Step 16








 




 
There is a slot on the wall of the battery compartment that locks the lower case in place. Use a small flathead screwdriver to pry out the slot's lower rim and pull up on the lower case to free the slot from the tabs holding it.

Step 17








 




 
Run a spudger along the seam between the lower case and upper case on the front of the computer to free the tabs locking the lower case. Pull up on the lower case and continue to use the spudger as necessary until you hear three distinct clicks.

Step 19








 




 
Once the front and sides of the lower case are free, turn the computer so that the back is facing you and pull the lower case up and toward you until the back tabs pop free (it may be helpful to jiggle the case up and down).

This is a diagram of the trackpad ribbon clamp connector you will disconnect in the next step.



 
1) With your fingernails, grasp the locking bar on either side and pull up a small amount (about 1/16" or 2 mm).



 
2) After disengaging the locking bar, slide the cable out of the connector.

Step 30








 




 
Before you can jerk the upper case off with joy, you must disconnect both the blue and white power cable and red and black speaker cable as described in the next steps.



 
Lift the upper case from the left side and use your other hand to pull out the right side in order to clear the power receptacle.



 
There may be a thin metal bar fastened to the upper case by the two screws on either side of the optical drive. This bar provides rigidity around the optical drive; don't forget it when reassembling.

Step 31








 




 
The connectors at the ends of the cables are attached very firmly to the sockets on the logic board. Pulling directly on the cable will either separate the cable from its connector or the socket from the logic board.



 
Lift the upper case enough to disconnect the blue and white power cable from the logic board. Using your fingernails or a dental pick, carefully pry the connector from its socket. Make sure you're pulling only on the connector and not on the socket.

There is a magnet that allows the computer to detect when the laptop is closed. If this magnet is not present your computer will not automatically go to sleep. Be sure the magnet is in the position indicated.

Four 5 mm Phillips



 
If a screw is inserted in the left hole, the 14.2 mm screw in step 24 can not be inserted to hold the top case down.
